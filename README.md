# Space-App-Project
## Project Summary 
This project is a web application that provides multiple different types of astronomical information. Our goal is for our users to be able to access this information as easy as possible, and to provide a website that is easy to navigate through.

### How to use the app:
When you load the website the first screen will have a title at the top, and then a login link on the top right that you can click and it will lead you to your account creation. Create an account and you will be taken to a page that will ask you which state and city you're in. There's also an option for putting in your email for a weekly newsletter. From here in the top right part of the page there is a history link that shows your search history, a search link to go back to searching your state and city, and a logout link. 

### Feautures: 
- Uses openweather api 
- Uses Nasa Apis 
- Able to create an account and login whenever

### Future Development 
- Geolocation implementation that will open up plenty of new possibilites
- Show nearby star gazing spots based on your location
